    <h1> Amazon Career</h1>
    2019 - Actual
<p>    Amazon was one place amazing and total in line of my principles as well.
        I believe in the hard-working and follow process to achieve one goal.
        Once I arrived in Amazon I have earned trust from my leaders following <br>
        standards and delivering the best service that they had seen before.        
        As Amazon has one mission to be the most customer centric company in the world<br>
        I believed totally in     <br> their principles and I follow in the working and in my personal life.
